Log Spam Cleanup: Whisper-STT Logging Suppression

üßπ EXCESSIVE LOGGING ELIMINATED:
- Added logging: driver: "none" to whisper-stt service in docker-compose.yml
- Completely suppresses HTTP request spam from onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice
- Maintains full service functionality while eliminating console clutter
- Preserves startup and health check logs for debugging

‚úÖ CLEAN OUTPUT VERIFIED:
- Service remains fully operational for STT transcriptions
- Health checks continue to function normally
- No more hundreds of "POST /asr" HTTP 200 OK messages
- Startup sequence remains clean and readable

üéØ SIMPLE SOLUTION ACHIEVED:
- No complex log filtering or custom commands required
- Uses Docker's built-in logging driver configuration
- Service continues to accept requests and process audio
- Perfect balance of functionality and clean console output

Console now shows only essential logs without whisper-stt HTTP spam.

Boot Sequence Fix: Service Readiness Checks and Health Monitoring

üîß STARTUP ORDER RESOLUTION:
- Created ServiceChecker utility to verify all backend services before bot connection
- Added comprehensive health checks for both STT and TTS services
- Bot now waits for service readiness confirmation before Discord connection
- Eliminated failed connection attempts during service initialization

üìä SERVICE HEALTH MONITORING:
- Added Docker Compose health checks with Python-based HTTP testing
- Whisper STT: /docs endpoint health check with 30s start period
- Piper TTS: /health endpoint health check with 15s start period
- Replaced depends_on with service_healthy conditions for proper orchestration

‚úÖ CLEAN STARTUP ACHIEVED:
- No more "Connection refused" errors during boot sequence
- Progressive service readiness reporting: "üîç Checking service readiness..."
- Clear success confirmation: "‚úÖ All services are ready\!"
- Proper error handling with timeout and retry logic

üéØ ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- ServiceChecker: Concurrent health checking with async/await
- Bot: Async startup flow with service dependency validation
- Docker: Health check intervals optimized for each service type
- Result: Robust, deterministic startup sequence

Boot sequence now provides reliable, ordered service initialization without failed connections.
