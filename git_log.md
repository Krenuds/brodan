Phase 3 Complete: MCP Server Configuration Fix

üîß CRITICAL MCP CONNECTIVITY RESOLVED:
- Fixed persistent MCP server connection failure that occurred on every Claude Code startup
- Root cause: voice-mode MCP server configured with 'uvx' command not in PATH
- Solution: Updated ~/.claude.json to use full path '/home/travis/.local/bin/uvx'
- Both GitHub and voice-mode MCP servers now connecting successfully

‚úÖ MCP SERVER STATUS:
- github MCP server: ‚úì Connected (Docker-based GitHub API integration)
- voice-mode MCP server: ‚úì Connected (uvx-based voice conversation handler)
- Configuration persistence: ‚úì Fixed - changes now save properly across sessions

üéØ PHASE 3 COMPLETION:
- ‚úì Voice-Mode MCP integration with environment setup (previous commit)
- ‚úì Discord Audio Bridge verification complete (previous commit)
- ‚úì MCP server connectivity issues resolved (this commit)
- üîÑ Ready for end-to-end voice conversation testing

This resolves the recurring "1 MCP server failed to connect" error that required manual fixing each session.

Phase 2 Complete: Discord Audio Bridge for voice-mode MCP integration

üåâ DISCORD AUDIO BRIDGE IMPLEMENTATION:
- Created OpenAI-compatible /v1/audio/transcriptions endpoint on port 9091
- FastAPI server with health check and models endpoints
- Real-time Discord audio streaming to whisper.cpp backend
- Multi-threaded audio processing with asyncio event loop isolation
- PCM to WAV conversion and 48kHz‚Üí16kHz audio resampling

üîó INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:
- audio_processor.py: Dual audio stream (STT + Bridge) from Discord voice
- bot.py: Background thread for Discord Audio Bridge server startup
- docker-compose.yml: Port 9091 exposure with environment variables
- requirements.txt: FastAPI, uvicorn, python-multipart dependencies

‚úÖ TESTING VALIDATION:
- Bridge server operational: http://localhost:9091/health returns "healthy"
- OpenAI compatibility: /v1/models and /v1/audio/transcriptions endpoints working
- Discord voice transcription functioning: "üé§ Test 1, 2, 3" successfully processed
- whisper.cpp integration: Bridge connects to whisper-stt service at port 9000
- Docker logs show clean operation with voice-mode MCP readiness

üéØ PHASE 2 SUCCESS CRITERIA MET:
- ‚úì Discord audio bridge operational on port 9091
- ‚úì OpenAI-compatible STT endpoints responding correctly
- ‚úì Real-time Discord audio streaming to bridge
- ‚úì Audio format conversions working properly
- ‚úì whisper.cpp backend integration functional

Ready for Phase 3: Voice-Mode MCP integration with Claude Code.

Phase 1 Immediate Fixes: Code review improvements and configuration corrections

üîß CONFIGURATION FIXES:
- Fix port fallback inconsistency: 9090 ‚Üí 9000 in src/stt_client.py for container compatibility
- Add model persistence: ASR_MODEL_PATH=/data/whisper with volume mapping to prevent re-downloads
- Fix URL construction: Remove unused /v1 path and use consistent base_url property

üì¶ DOCKER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add whisper-models:/data/whisper volume mapping to docker-compose.yml
- Add ASR_MODEL_PATH environment variable for model caching
- Verified onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice container integration

‚úÖ API ENDPOINT VALIDATION:
- Confirmed /asr endpoint implementation matches official documentation
- Verified request format: audio_file field, task=transcribe, output=json, language=en
- No need for OpenAI /v1/audio/transcriptions endpoint (container uses /asr)

üß™ TESTING COMPLETED:
- All services running successfully with proper connectivity
- whisper-stt service downloads base model to persistent cache (139MB)
- App successfully connects to STT service after container startup
- Docker logs show clean integration without connection errors

Phase 1 code review fixes complete - ready for Phase 2 Discord Audio Bridge implementation.
